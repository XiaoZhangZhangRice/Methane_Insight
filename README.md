# Brief description of project

Methane Insight is based on a laser based sensor. Methane insight was tested in rice fields to evaluate its ability to be used as a low cost sensor for CH4 flux measurements. 

Sensors were used in various locations, including California (Rice Experiment Station), Arkansas, and parts of Asia.
